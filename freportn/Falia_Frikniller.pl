Way bigger than humble little Rivervale. That's where I'm from. I'm working on setting up my own little business here, Falia's Foot Combs and Footwear, it'll be called. But, I don't have anything to sell yet, so check back in a couple of weeks. Safe travels to ye, friend.");

It was our grandfather's lucky necklace. He passed it down to our father, and now onto my brother. Knowing that little worm, Grenny, he'll probably trade it for a mug of ale. Oh well, thanks for delivering the letter, friend. Good day to you, and safe travels.");
