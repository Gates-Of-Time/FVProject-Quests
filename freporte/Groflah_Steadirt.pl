And most importantly of all, Ariska saw the apparent leader's sword. It was glowing with great energy. Suddenly, the evil knights were in a battle. The knights gave chase, leaving their camp unattended. The knight who owned the sword left it behind, opting to fight with another, leading me to believe it was not his to begin with. It was at this point that Ariska ran down and grabbed the sword. A few weeks later, we were to learn that the knight was a powerful man by the name of Pietro Zarn and that he was looking for a sword stolen from him. He called it .. Soulfire. I believe Zarn must have finally found Ariska.");
