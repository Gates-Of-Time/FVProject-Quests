This race was quite intelligent and cunning. They quickly expanded their knowledge of magic and other planes, yet constantly yearned for more power. So along with their ogre counterparts, they set out to master the Plane of Earth. Alas, their attempts proved futile and the combined might of the other gods forced Rallos Zek back to the Planes of Power, leaving his creations to the whims of other gods.");

The giants were flung across the face of Norrath like seeds to the wind. The Ankexfen's fate was more severe. The entire race was exterminated, but from the ashes were born the four goblin races. Exactly how this happened is unknown. But what is known is that each goblin was stripped of any knowledge and was neither informed of the other clans nor of their origins. Each clan was then transported to a separate environment to help preserve the gods will. However, the gods were not without mercy and each clan was granted a section of the staff. Upon each staff a crystal was adorned. These staves served to aid the goblin clans in understanding their environment. These remnants of the Staff of Ankexfen are what I desire. Bring them to me and the Priests of Innoruuk shall reward you.");
